# Protocol for assessing the computational reproducibility of simulation models

This repository contains the Latex documents creating the STARS protocol for simulation reproduction. These are synced with and imported from Overleaf.

It includes a workflow image produced using draw.io. To export the image at high quality on draw.io, you should go to File > Export as > Advanced, and then set the DPI to 300dpi and unselect transparent background.
