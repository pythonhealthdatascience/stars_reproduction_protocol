# Protocol for assessing the computational reproducibility of discrete-event simulation models on STARS

⭐ Protocol: **STARS_WP1_Reproduction_Protocol.pdf** ⭐

This repository contains the Latex documents creating the STARS protocol for simulation reproduction. These are synced with and imported from Overleaf.

It includes a workflow image produced using draw.io. To export the image at high quality on draw.io, you should go to File > Export as > Advanced, and then set the DPI to 300dpi and unselect transparent background.

The protocol has been published on Zenodo:
