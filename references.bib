	abstract = {We carry out efforts to reproduce computational results for seven published articles and identify barriers to computational reproducibility. We then derive three principles to guide the practice and dissemination of reproducible computational research: (i) Provide transparency regarding how computational results are produced; (ii) When writing and releasing research software, aim for ease of (re-)executability; (iii) Make any code upon which the results rely as deterministic as possible. We then exemplify these three principles with 12 specific guidelines for their implementation in practice. We illustrate the three principles of reproducible research with a series of vignettes from our experimental reproducibility work. We define a novel Reproduction Package, a formalism that specifies a structured way to share computational research artifacts that implements the guidelines generated from our reproduction efforts to allow others to build, reproduce and extend computational science. We make our reproduction efforts in this paper publicly available as exemplar Reproduction Packages.

	abstract = {3ie’s Replication Programme is conducting a PBRproject.PBR studies test the ability for another researcher to use data and code to reproduce the originally published results.PBR researchersare not tasked with evaluating the quality of the original research or testing the robustness of the original results to any type of sensitivity analysis. They are also not expected to explore any original coding decisions. When conducting PBRstudies, 3ie requires researchers to follow a set protocol. The steps of the protocol are listed sequentially and outlined below.Each paper subject to replication will have a unique component in the Open Science Framework (OSF)platform.},
