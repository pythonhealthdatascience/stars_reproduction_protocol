\section{Evaluation against guidelines}

\subsection{Badges} \label{sec:badges}
\timeno

Various organisations and journals have developed badges which can be displayed alongside a published research article to indicate how open and potentially reproducible it is, as detailed in Appendix \ref{appendix:badges}.

For this study, the researcher should:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Evaluate the artefacts \textbf{made available by the author} (code, data, documentation) against the criteria of different badges (as in Tables 1 to 3 in Appendix \ref{appendix:badges}). \textit{To be clear, this is not evaluating the repository created by the researcher whilst reproducing the study, but just the original author artefacts.}
    \item Identify which of the badges it meets the criteria for.
\end{enumerate}

Within our Quarto template (\url{https://github.com/pythonhealthdatascience/stars_reproduction_template}), a skeleton page is provided for completion of this task.\hl{make that page}

\hl{should we add images/text of badges to readme, or is that misleading if (a) a study gets lots of open badges but not reproducible ones, and (b) it is awarded by us and not an external body}

\subsection{Code sharing guidelines} \label{sec:code}

STARS

Any other major or relevant to DES.

\subsection{Reporting guidelines} \label{sec:reporting}
\timeno

\hlblue{\textbf{Grant:} Assess extent meets STRESS-DES and ISPOR-SDM reporting guidelines \textbf{Progress:} Not done yet. \textbf{To discuss though!:} Lots of examples doing similar work look also at code and compare against frameworks for how structure and share code - for example could compare against STARS - would we want to do that or not? Often used like context of "this didn't run" and "it didn't layout like we know is handy" type thing.}

Rough notes from Tom

Following the reproducibility test, we will assess the extent to which each paper follows the items recommended in:
The STRESS-DES reporting guidelines
The recent DES reporting guidelines published in Value in Health and based on ISPOR-SDM task force reports (Zhang et al, 2020)
We will score items as fully, partially, or not meeting the requirements.
